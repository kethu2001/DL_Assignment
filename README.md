# 🧠 Garbage Classification using Deep Learning ♻️

A deep learning project developed as part of our final-year assignment at **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)**.  
Our goal was to build an accurate image classification model to identify different types of household waste and support sustainable waste management practices.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Improper waste segregation is a major challenge in many countries, including Sri Lanka.  
Automatic garbage classification can help improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental pollution.

---

## 📦 Dataset
- **Source:** [Garbage Classification Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Size:** 15,150 images  
- **Classes (12 total):**  
  `paper`, `cardboard`, `biological`, `metal`, `plastic`, `brown-glass`, `green-glass`, `white-glass`, `clothes`, `shoes`, `batteries`, `trash`

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing
- Image resizing to **224×224**
- Normalization  
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)
- Train-test split  

---

## 🧪 Deep Learning Models (Supervised Learning)
| Model | Accuracy |
|:------|:----------:|
| ✅ MobileNetV2 | **91.90%** |
| ✅ ResNet50 | **91.77%** |
| ✅ InceptionV3 | **89.90%** |
| ✅ Custom CNN | **75.68%** |

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React.js  
**Backend / Model Integration:** Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Flask)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Real-time detection using cameras on conveyor belts in recycling centers  
- Expanding dataset with real-world garbage images  
- Deployable edge solutions for low-resource environments
